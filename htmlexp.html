        <h1> What is HTML?</h1>
        <h2> To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:</h2>
        <div class="dif">
            <details>
                <summary>HyperText</summary>
                text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items
            </details>
        </div>

        <div class="dif">
            <details>
                <summary>Markup</summary> a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy
                format
            </details>
        </div>

        <div class="dif">
            <details>
                <summary>Language:</summary> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret
                commands.<details>
        </div>

        HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and
        interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add
        interactivity, respectively.

        <div class="dif">
            <details>
                <summary>HTML Tags</summary>HTML Tags
                Since HTML defines the markup for a particular web page, you'll want the text, images, or other embeds
                to appear in certain ways.

                For example, you might want some text to be big, other text to be small, and some to be bold, italic, or
                in bullet point form.

        <div> Top 3 Types of Tags in HTML
            An HTML document is created using different types of tags. HTML tags can be defined and divided based on a
            different basis. Let’s see them in the coming parts of this article. We have divided HTML tags based on the
            following classifications:</div>
        <div>
            1. Paired and Unpaired Tags
            Following are the paired and unpaired tags in HTML explained in detail with the help of examples.</div>

        <h2>Paired Tags</h2>
        An HTML tag is known as a paired tag when the tag consists of an opening tag and a closing tag as its companion
        tag. An HTML Paired tag starts with an opening tag: the tag name enclosed inside the angle brackets; for
        example, a paragraph opening tag is written as ‘<p>’. The content follows the opening tag, which ends with an
            ending tag: the tag name starting with a forward slash; for example, an ending paragraph tag is written as ‘
            < /p>’. The first tag can be referred to as the ‘Opening Tag’, and the second tag can be called Closing <
                    Tag class="br">
                    < /Tag> <br><br><br>
                        <span>
                            Example #1:

                            < p> This text is a paragraph . < /p> <br>
                                    Output: This is a paragraph
                        </span>
    </div>
    <h2> Unpaired Tags</h2>
    An HTML tag is called an unpaired tag when the tag only has an opening tag and does not have a closing tag or a
    companion tag. The Unpaired HTML tag does not require a closing tag; an opening tag is sufficient in this type.
    Unpaired tags are sometimes also named as Standalone Tags or Singular Tags since they do not require a companion
    tag.
    <p>
        Example:
    <pre>
< p> This is a paragraph < /p>
< hr>
< i>  < b> This is a bold and italicized text < /b> < i> <br>
Output:
This is a paragraph
<i><b>This is a bold and italicized text</b></i></pre>
    <br><br>
    Note: Here, the < hr> is the unpaired tag used to create a horizontal line. In older versions, you might see hr tag
        written as
        < hr /> instead of < hr>. These tags are also called Empty Tag.
            2. Self-Closing Tags
            Self-Closing Tags are those HTML tags that do not have a partner tag, where the first tag is the only
            necessary tag that is valid for the formatting. The main and important information is contained WITHIN the
            element as its attribute. An image tag is a classic example of a self-closing tag. Let’s see it in action
            below:

            Example:

            < img src="a.jpg" alt="This is an alternate text">
                Note: In the older versions, the self-closing tags use a ‘forward slash’ before the ending or closing
                ‘greater than’ sign/symbol, as written below:

                < img src=”a.jpg” alt=”This is an alternate text” />

                3. Utility-Based Tags
                The HTML tags can be widely differentiated on the basis of their utility, that is, on the basis of the
                purpose they serve. We can divide them basically into three categories as discussed below:

                Formatting Tags
                The HTML tags that help us in the formatting of the texts like the size of the text, font styles, making
                a text bold, etc. This is done using tags like < font>, < b>, < u>, etc. Tables, divisions, and span
                            tags are also those tags that help format a web page or document and set the layout of the
                            page. Below is a small program using divisions for formatting the page along with some other
                            formatting tags.

                            Example:
                            <pre>
< body> 
< div class="container">
< div class="row">
< div class="col-25">
< label for="email"><b>Name</b></label>
< /div>
< div class="col-35">
< input type="text" placeholder="First" name="fname" required>
< /div>
< div class="col-35">
< input type="text" placeholder="Last" name="lname" required>
< /div>
< /div>
< /div>
< /body>
</pre>
                            Output: <br>
                            <img src="s.jpg" alt="">
                            <h2>Structure Tags</h2>
                            The HTML tags that help in structuring the HTML document are called Structure Tags.
                            Description, head, html, title, body, etc., form the group of the page structure tags. The
                            structure tags only assist in creating or forming the basic html page from the root; that
                            is, they do not affect or has any hand in the formatting of texts. So a basic HTML program
                            is the basic group of structural tags:
                            <br>
                            Example:
                            <pre>
    < !doctype html>
    < html>
    < head>
    < meta charset="utf-8">
